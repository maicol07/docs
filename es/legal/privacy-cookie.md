# Information in brief

- Our main interest is to protect customers through our services.
- To do so, we must process data about you and your devices.
- Maicol07 respects your privacy.

Our guiding principles regarding privacy are set out below.

## Privacy principles

Your privacy is very important to us. We believe in defending the right to privacy and we defend it at any cost.

### 1. We respect the right to privacy

We respect your privacy in every aspect of our business. Trust is at the heart of everything: we guarantee you control of your personal data and digital content through the prevention of unauthorized access. We ask you for information only to improve our services and if strictly necessary.

### 2. We will protect you

Not only do we act according to our principles, but we also want to protect you from external threats. We are able to do this through our services and by sharing our important digital ecosystem data with you. Your digital life should be your own and nobody else's business.

### 3. Decide what to share with us

To improve our services and communications, we collect data on the retrieval and use of our applications. Our services monitor the most commonly used features and the causes of error messages.

### 4. No backdoors

Maicol07 software and services are without backdoors for access by authorities or others. Government officials must explicitly and mandatorily request information necessary for criminal investigations.

### 5. There is no privacy without security

Security services contribute to the protection of sensitive data from unauthorized persons and cybercriminals. Security is the only way to ensure privacy. Maicol07's privacy activities and security expertise offer real digital freedom.

### 6. Our messages are always relevant

We want to protect your digital world also with relevant communications. Our communication goes beyond simple marketing: we disseminate useful and engaging information to help you get the most out of our services. You can stop sending messages at any time.

### 7. We choose only reliable service providers

As digital service providers in the Internet ecosystem, we must sometimes resort to external solutions, selecting our partners carefully and based on our commitment to privacy and security. We only share data that is strictly necessary for service delivery.

### 8. We are on the side of the good

Every quality software is based on a team of exceptional people. Maicol07's culture is based on honesty and integrity. We consider the Internet a free system and a great advantage for humanity. Therefore, we do everything we can to protect privacy and digital freedom.

### 9. Transparency

We always adopt maximum transparency, without using your personal data for purposes other than those stated, communicating clearly, simply and without technical jargon.

# Structure

This privacy policy is provided by Maicol07 and applies to all software and services of Maicol07 Network.

Data collection can be divided into categories as indicated below:

- Customer relationship data; the data necessary to manage relations with our customers and to market and sell our services to the user or the legal entity it represents.
- Service data; data processed automatically to provide the customer with the services he or she has requested. This also includes data that the customer has actively submitted when subscribing to the services.
- Analytical data; additional anonymous data or pseudonyms collected to understand when and how the services are found and used.

The Privacy Policy describes the common practices adopted by Maicol07 to process customer personal data. It also incorporates service-specific privacy policies as well as license terms and other shorter notices about case-specific data collection (e.g., support tools). Depending on the services used and the level of customer interaction, some sections of this policy do not apply to the customer or apply only in part.

If there is no specific policy to govern a particular interaction, this Privacy Policy will apply.

# Definitions

Here is what is meant by certain references to this regulation.

"Customer" refers to a private or business user or any other interested party who purchases, registers for use or uses our services, whose devices and data traffic are protected by our services and who may have sent personally identifiable information to Maicol07information may have been sent through the use of our services, websites, telephone, e-mail, registration forms or other similar channels.

The term "Personal Data" refers to information about private individuals through which the individual identifies themselves or are identified by their family or other related members. This information includes names, email and postal addresses, telephone numbers and billing and account information, as well as other more technical information that may be associated with you, your device or the behavior of both, which we process to provide our services.

The term "Services" refers to services and products created or distributed by Maicol07, including software, web solutions, tools and related support services.

The term "Website" refers to all websites of the Maicol07 Network (hereinafter, "networks") or other sites hosted or controlled by Maicol07, including secondary sites and browser-based service portals.

# Nature of data collected

The service and interaction criteria explain in more detail what personal data is collected according to the type of service and interaction.

# Type of use

The interactions, information and privacy notices specific to the service define the specific purposes for the use of personal data collected by each service or processed in that activity.

In addition to these specific purposes, the following general purposes for the use of personal data apply to all of our services:

## Provisioning of the service

To provide you with our services, we process data for the following purposes:

### Customer path

Identify authorized users, process and track transactions, administer accounts, shipping, billing and license management.

### Provide, correct and improve

Provide, support and develop websites and services and provide help and support regarding these.

### Analyze

Keep track of how our services are acquired and used so that we can improve services, manage customer relationships and communicate relevant messages to you.

## Communicate

Send you information about our services, conduct customer surveys and market our services. The actual communication can be managed by F-Secure or its partners.

## Regulations

Avoid fraudulent activity, prevent or stop sharing illegal or illegal material and comply with legal or regulatory requirements.

# Legal scope

This section provides a more complete explanation of the legal reasons on the basis of which we process personal data and integrates the exact legal reasons specific to the service on which the processing of personal data carried out by us for the respective activity is based.

## Customer relationship data

By using our services, you agree to be our customer. In order to interact with you and provide our services to customers, we must process certain data about you. Such processing generally occurs when users communicate with Maicol07 in relation to the services provided, installation or registration and use, filling in forms or surveys, sending information via Maicol07 web solutions, participating in contests and sweepstakes, registering their email address or sending email messages.

Since we need the data to pursue the above legitimate activities, we have the right to process the relevant personal data. Normally this right is exercised in the form of "contractual performance", "legitimate interest" or "consent".

## Analysis data

Maicol07 also reuses the service data for data analysis purposes, based on the legal reasons established above. Data analysis is an integral part of our service provision, as almost all Maicol07 services depend on our infrastructure to function properly. Data analysis enables us to direct the infrastructure to support the use of the services.

Where services only collect data that is necessary to obtain more information about how users use them or how to improve them, but is not necessary for their operation, it will only be collected with separate consent. You also have the right to revoke this consent at a later date if you wish.

The legal basis for the collection of data exclusively for analysis purposes is therefore the "consent".

## Secondary uses

In addition to the above primary legal grounds for data collection, Maicol07 may need to use and/or continue to store data to meet a "legal obligation" to process data for specific purposes, or ii) for reasons of "legitimate interest". For a list of examples of situations in which such legal grounds may be used, see the "Other Disclosures" section.

## General Information

The user is considered a customer of Maicol07 and not a customer of the single service. This means that Maicol07 combines in the user's account the data collected through the different services (e.g. Scheduled Queries) and interactions (e.g. by contacting support). However, it does not aggregate data unless specified as agreed on privacy (for example, we maintain an approach that does not interfere with traffic within the VPN service).

# Transfer and disclosure

We do a lot ourselves but we have partners who help us to provide our services. This also means that we have to exchange data with our partners. When we do this, we take care to share only the personal information we need.

The most significant exchanges of data with our partners are defined primarily in the service specific privacy policy (if defined). The following details affect this information and also list other data and data transfers that occur for all or almost all of Maicol07's personal data processing activities.

# Other cases of use and disclosure

There are circumstances not covered by these privacy policies in which the use or disclosure of personal information may be justified or permitted, or in which we are required by applicable law to disclose information without requesting your consent or independent of the provision of the service.

An example includes complying with a court order or warrant issued by the authorities in the jurisdiction responsible for producing the information.

Similarly, there may be other circumstances in which there is a legitimate interest in disclosing limited sets of information to third parties. Examples of such disclosures include cases where it is necessary to protect against possible liability or prevent fraudulent activity, where it is necessary to resolve or mitigate an ongoing problem or meet legitimate disclosure requirements of our insurers or government regulatory agencies. In such cases, Maicol07 will act in accordance with applicable law.

We carefully evaluate any disclosure requirements and consider the possibility that we may have to address such disclosure requests when deciding where and how to store your personal information.

# Sources

While Maicol07 collects most of the above mentioned data directly from the customer or his device, it also receives data from third party partners. Maicol07 also acquires some basic personal data (date of orders for purchases) and aggregates the analytical data of the app stores where the services are sold. These other sources may also include contractors who have provided customer support for our services or advertising partners who have assisted Maicol07 in marketing activities.

All this serves to ensure that the customer has a consistent experience and has the information necessary to resolve support cases.

Some typical examples of third party sources are:

- information on purchases made by the user through PayPal or Stripe,
- where the customer uses their social account to register and access services, the email address of the account is used to authenticate the customer's registration and contact them.

# Third parties

Our services are provided in collaboration with partners; our services and websites may incorporate or interoperate with third party services. This privacy policy applies only to personal data provided that such data is under the influence of Maicol07. Where your personal data is processed by other entities for their own independent purposes, those entities will be responsible for processing your personal data in a legally correct manner, in accordance with their respective policies and in compliance with the rights granted to you by the Data Protection Act.

The prevailing scenarios of this kind are as follows:

- Payments via PayPal or Stripe. Payments for the services we offer are generally processed by a third party platform, such as [PayPal](https://paypal.com) or [Stripe](https://stripe.com). The data that the customer enters during the registration phase are managed according to Maicol07 criteria, while the _payment processor_ criteria apply to the actual purchase and related activities.

# Storage

The present text integrates the specific indications on service retention times. The default rule of law is that personal data are deleted or made anonymous once they are no longer needed for the intended purpose.

However, some personal data must still be stored for longer periods of variable duration, for different reasons.

Typical reasons why primary retention times are extended include the following examples:

- grace and backup periods (for example, to keep personal data stored for a specified period of time after the end of your subscription so that you can safeguard your data from incorrect deletion);
- if required by applicable law (e.g. to keep track of a purchase and payment for our services);
- to enable us to seek available remedies or to limit the damages to be incurred (e.g. due to a dispute or an ongoing investigation);
- to resolve or limit a recurring problem or to have sufficient information to respond to future problems (e.g., a service ticket related to a problem that has not been permanently corrected during the time you were our customer);
- to prevent fraudulent activity (e.g., enforce an expulsion from our community)
- your personal data is incorporated into other data for a secondary purpose (e.g., retention records);
- other similar circumstances in which there is still a legitimate need for permanent storage of personal data.

The permanent removal of your account may be delayed to avoid interrupting other interactions between you and Maicol07. This is the case when you have a Maicol07 account (for example, if you subscribe to consumer services with your email address) and also i) have an account in the Maicol07 network or ii) your subscription to marketing messages is not cancelled. The policy for unsubscribing from the Maicol07 network is set out in the terms of service. You may deactivate the sending of marketing messages at any time.

If you have purchased the service through our operator partners, the deletion of your account is controlled by that operator partner. When the partner notifies us of the termination of the subscription, Maicol07 removes the account and deletes or anonymizes the personal data associated with it.

If Maicol07 has received your information to provide technical support, that information is stored until the respective support case is resolved. Once closed, the information is gradually deleted or anonymized within two years after the case is closed.

Analytical data collected with your consent is stored for statistical purposes and is not deleted during the removal of your personal data and user account. Analytical data cannot be associated with a specific user after the account has been deleted.

Data that does not contain personal data (e.g. security data and aggregated analytical data) is retained as long as it is useful for the purpose for which it was collected.
Security

We apply strict security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal data during transfer, storage or processing.

Maicol07 uses physical, administrative and technical security measures to reduce the risk of loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of your personal data.

All personal data is stored on secure servers operated by Maicol07 or our partners with access limited to authorized personnel only.

# Your rights

You have rights to the data in our possession about you. In particular, you have the following rights with regard to your personal data in our possession:

### Access and rectification

You have the right to ask us what personal data about you is in our possession and to request a copy of the data traceable to you in this context. If you find any errors (such as outdated information) in this data, please contact our customer service department to resolve the issue. Some of our service portals allow you to update your customer information. To do so, please update any changes in your personal information, such as a change to an address or email address. If you cannot update your information yourself, please contact us and we will do it for you.

### Objection

You have the right to object to certain methods of processing your personal data, for example for marketing reasons or when we base our processing of your data on legitimate interests. In the latter case, you must provide a legally valid reason for your objection.

### Right to be forgotten

You also have the right to ask us to stop storing your personal data and to delete it. In this case, you must provide a valid legal reason for the request.

### Portability

You also have the right to request personal data provided by you, following a contract or your consent. You may request them in a structured, common and computer readable format, as well as request that they be transmitted to another data controller, where technically feasible.

### Revocation of consent

In cases where processing follows your consent, you have the right to revoke this consent at any time via the relevant settings. For identifiable service analysis data, you can find the settings in the service user interface. You also have the right to stop marketing communications that you receive via the preferences center, which can be accessed via the link.

### Limitation

If you determine that your data in our possession is incorrect or that we do not have the legal rights to use it, you may request that any further processing be discontinued in order to keep it only stored until the problem is resolved.

You can exercise your rights by contacting us from the website https://maicol07.it from the chat at the bottom right or from the contact form at the bottom of the page.

There may be certain situations where our obligations of confidentiality, our right to professional secrecy and/or our obligations to provide our services (for example, to your employer) may prevent us from communicating or deleting your personal data or otherwise prevent you from exercising your rights. Your above rights also depend on the legal basis for the processing of your personal data.

If you wish to make a complaint about the processing of your personal data by Maicol07 or would like further information, please contact us at any time.

# Analytics

This section explains our general practices for collecting and processing data for analysis purposes.

When referring to Maicol07's data analysis, this reference includes both reused service and security data and data collected for initial analysis purposes.

Maicol07 wants to provide a more personal customer experience and better services in the future. This is why it records usage patterns and aggregated customer segments. For example, which features are used the most, where there are problems with the services, what needs to be met and how to access the services.

## Data collected

The data we process for analysis purposes include elements such as device identifiers and relationships between devices / users / user groups, operating environment, service operating time, license type (trial or paid version), device metrics (such as phone model, operating system and language), partial IP addresses, service errors, problematic files and URLs, service performance data, how you interact with our services (e.g. what features are used and how often), domain names from which you connect to the service, timestamps, installation and activation paths, service performance and other similar data (not always all data mentioned between the previous lines are used).

On a practical level, when we ask for your consent in the user interface of our services, it checks whether the following data is sent: i) additional data, such as the functions used with the corresponding frequency of use and the metrics of the service and ii) the number of attributes sent in a given data set.

## Opting out

Maicol07 appreciates your help to improve its services. However, if you wish to minimize all data traffic to Maicol07, your decision will be respected. Those services that use further analysis allow you to choose whether or not to make a contribution. You may discontinue your participation at any time in the subsequent collection of analytical data, which is not essential to the provision of the service.

If you have discontinued your participation in the collection of all analytical data, the messaging will be based only on the data collection of the service (data collected in any case to provide the services) and the advice contained in some messages will be less relevant.

If you do not wish to authorize the collection of analytical data from your online experience (including on Maicol07 sites), the most radical way to prevent online advertisers from profiling your mobile device usage is to reset the advertising identifier from time to time and enable the option to prevent tracking in device settings or use our privacy product.

## Analytical Data Retention

In our data analysis activities, we combine analysis data with service data. The resulting combined data set therefore continues to be processed on the basis of a "legitimate interest". The analytical data collected previously are stored as part of the service statistics, as their retroactive removal would interrupt the statistics. When you cancel your subscription to our services (for example, by deleting your account), the analytical data relating to the use of the service is converted into anonymous data and can no longer be associated with you.

## Exchange of data

Given the technical environment (i.e. the Internet, the app store ecosystem and social media), Maicol07 is not able to perform the entire collection and activities related to data analysis independently and is therefore forced to exchange some data (such as the "Android Marketing Identifier" and other similar identifiers) with its online analysis and marketing partners to enable its digital analysis and marketing activities. Most of the user data held by F-Secure is not shared with others.

Some contractors with whom Maicol07 collaborates to provide analysis functions for its products may also create and publish aggregate reports on the data collected. In this case, the aggregated statistics and reports do not contain data that could be linked to any individual.

# Cookies

To enrich and perfect your online experience, Maicol07 websites and services across the network uses "Cookies", similar technologies and services provided by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising and store your preferences on your computer.

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Our services and websites uses cookies to help identifying and tracking visitors, their usage on the service, and their website access preferences. Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using our websites and services, with the drawback that certain features may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

By continuing to navigate our website without changing your cookie settings, you hereby acknowledge and agree to the service or website use of cookies.

# Modifications

This version of the policy clarifies, updates and replaces the previous version. To keep this document up-to-date, Maicol07 will make changes and additions from time to time, also in the future.

The updated version of the Privacy Policy will be published on Maicol07's website or at another point of interaction where it was previously made available. In the event of material changes, you may receive further notification by other means. Any changes will take effect on the date the updated Privacy Policy is published.
