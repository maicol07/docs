If you came here across the web, you want to become one of our translators. As you may know, we offer community-crowded translations, which means that our translations are made by community users like you. So, how can you become a translator? You need to follow some steps in order to start translating a project.

1. **Sign up on the translation platform**
   Go to [Maicol07 Translate](https://translate.maicol07.it) and click Login (or Signup) and press "continue with Maicol07 Account" to login to your [Maicol07 Account](https://account.maicol07.it)

2. **Select a project you want to translate and your language!**
   Once you have signed up and logged in, go to the home page of the translation platform and find the project you want to translate. Click on it and you will see the list of languages you can translate. If you don't find your language you can request it by contacting me from Crowdin (three dots menu --> Contact on the right in project page) or by creating a discussion in the [request category](https://community.maicol07.it/t/requests) in Community

3. **Start translating!**
   Once your language has been added and it is available for translation, you can start your work! However, source strings are in Italian, so you need to see them in another language if you don't understand Italian. Youcan do it by expanding the Other Languages section at the bottom of the editor:

4. **(Optional) Translator badge**
   If you want to get all the news and updates about translating the projects or just talk about this in our community, you can request access to translators "Translators Space", a reserved community category dedicated only to translators. Just write into the [Access requests](https://community.maicol07.it/t/access-requests) on the community.

Our translation platform is powered by [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com)
